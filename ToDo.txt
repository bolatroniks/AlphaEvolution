Command to look for ToDos (-i => case insensitive) in the code:
grep -e ToDo -i -rnw --exclude-dir={datasets,venv,Trading_old,.idea} ./

Update Readme file
- inline with the presentation or just refer it
- refer to demo files

Add demo files showing how to use Chromossome to create trading rules from scratch

Chromossome/Gene:
1/ bring implementation of Gene in line with presentation
- ie, make it simple to create different types of genes
- timeseries, cross-secion, etc
- long/short, not buy, not sell, binary conditions
- symmetrical/asymmetrical

2/ HMM (gene):
- make it simple to create rules based on HMM
- eg.: 
    long USD/ZAR based on SPX monthly HMM state
    long/short UST based on claims (better PMI) HMM
    
3/ candle pattern genes
- high confidence reversals
- shooting star / hammer
- convolution

4/ SVM (based on a Chromossome)
- activation threshold (at least 70% of signals active)
- negative sampling (randomly pick examples)
- save a dataset containing the activations of the genes
- train classifier based on this dataset

5/ Genetic algorithm selection/championship implementation

Deep Learning (research)

- auto-encoding:
    - dense or sparse
    - single candle or small sequence
    
- embedding
    - borrow ideas from NLP, word2vec
