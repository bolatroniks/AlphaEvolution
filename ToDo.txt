Command to look for ToDos (-i => case insensitive) in the code:
grep -e ToDo -i -rnw --exclude-dir={datasets,venv,Trading_old,.idea} ./

Update Readme file
- inline with the presentation or just refer it
- refer to demo files

Add demo files showing how to use Chromossome to create trading rules from scratch

Chromossome/Gene:
1/ bring implementation of Gene in line with presentation
- ie, make it simple to create different types of genes
- timeseries, cross-secion, etc
DONE - long/short, not buy, not sell, binary conditions
DONE - symmetrical/asymmetrical

2/ HMM (gene):
- make it simple to create rules based on HMM
- eg.: 
    long USD/ZAR based on SPX monthly HMM state
    long/short UST based on claims (better PMI) HMM
    
3/ candle pattern genes
DONE - high confidence reversals
DONE - shooting star / hammer
DONE - convolution

4/ SVM (based on a Chromossome)
- activation threshold (at least 70% of signals active)
- negative sampling (randomly pick examples)
- save a dataset containing the activations of the genes
- train classifier based on this dataset

5/ Genetic algorithm selection/championship implementation
- create a gene pool
    - make a list of features already implemented
    - to implement:
        -trend stationarity: ct, ctt, halflife > x
        - ARDL, VECM, EC
        - HMM
        
- create a big chromossome and generate permutations

IMPORTANT:
    - some rules already show promising results
    - need to put these to run

Deep Learning (research)

- auto-encoding:
    - dense or sparse
    - single candle or small sequence
    
- embedding
    - borrow ideas from NLP, word2vec
